3.2       “Licensee Application” means software, applications, code, programs, libraries, APIs, or any other type of machine-readable instructions Licensee creates, alters, or modifies using the Development Tool.

3.3       Subject to Licensee’s compliance with Section 4 this Agreement, Zebra hereby grants Licensee a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license to, during the Term:

3.3.1           reproduce the Development Tool internally in object code format for the purpose of integrating the Development Tool with or otherwise developing a Licensee Application that is configured to interface with, support, or function with a Zebra Product;

3.3.2           if Zebra provides Licensee source code with or as part of the Development Tool, modify the source code to create a derivative work thereof only for use in a Licensee Application that is configured to interface with, support, or function with a Zebra Product; and

3.6       The Development Tool is licensed; not sold. Zebra reserves all right, title, and interest not expressly granted in this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement provides or grants Licensee any ownership or license rights to Zebra Products, including software or hardware that the Development Tool is designed to support. Any such right must be obtained through a separate agreement or purchase of a Zebra Product.

3.7       No license is granted herein under any Zebra patents that are infringed by Licensee’s integrations made pursuant to Section 3.3.1, modifications made pursuant to Section 3.3.2, or distributions made pursuant to Section 3.3.3.

4.2       The rights granted to Licensee hereunder cannot be used or otherwise applied to anyone other than Licensee.

4.3       Licensee may not assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without prior written consent from Zebra.

### 9            Third-Party Content

9.1          Access to and use of third-party Content or services is subject to terms and conditions provided by the third party and may be protected by the third-party’s intellectual property rights.

9.2          Third-party resources linked or made available via the Development Tool are not considered part of the Development Tool, and Zebra reserves the right to, at its sole discretion, disable integrations of third-party Content or services or compatibility of the Development Tool therewith. Nothing in this Agreement is a license, permission, or assignment of any rights in or to such third-party Content or services.

9.3          Licensee acknowledges that if the Development Tool requires access to non-Zebra hardware, non-Zebra software, or non-Zebra Content to perform a function or provide a feature and Licensee denies such permission, the corresponding function or feature will not be available or execute properly.

### 17         Confidentiality

17.1   “Confidential Information” is defined as any non-public information, data, software, or object related to the Development Tool or this Agreement that is provided or conveyed to Licensee by Zebra in oral, written, graphic, machine recognizable, and/or physical form. Source code of the Development Tool and the structure and organization thereof are Confidential Information.

17.2   During the Term and a period of five (5) years thereafter – except with respect to trade secrets for which obligations of this paragraph apply during the Term and will continue beyond the Term until the information no longer qualifies as a trade secret under applicable law by means other than Licensee’s unauthorized disclosure thereof – Licensee shall (i) restrict disclosure of Confidential Information to only those who are bound by this Agreement and must be directly involved with the Confidential Information for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) use the same degree of care as for your own information of like importance, but at least use reasonable care, in safeguarding against unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information; (iii) promptly notify Zebra in writing upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information and take reasonable steps to regain possession of the Confidential Information and prevent further unauthorized actions or other breach of this Agreement; and (iv) only use the Confidential Information for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement.

17.3   The obligations set forth in Section 17.2 will not apply to any portion of the Confidential Information that (i) is or becomes available to the public through means other than Licensee’s unauthorized disclosure; (ii) is explicitly approved for release by written authorization of Zebra; (iii) is lawfully obtained from a third party without breach of a confidentiality obligation; (iv) is known to Licensee prior to such disclosure; or (v) is independently developed by Licensee without the use of any of Zebra’s Confidential Information or any breach of this Agreement.
