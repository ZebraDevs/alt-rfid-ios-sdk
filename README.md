The Zebra RFID SDK for iOS enables MFi-enabled devices to interface with the RFD8500, RFD40, and RF90 via its Bluetooth interface. The Zebra RFID SDK provides a powerful set of APIs that use directly the ZETI (Zebra Easy Text Interface) exclusively created to take full advantage of the RFD8500, RFD40, and RF90 performance, functionality, and versatility. The SDK also contains the Zebra RFID Mobile application that can be used as a reference to develop new applications or to port existing applications to take advantage of the RFID features.
